# üèóÔ∏è Project Progress Report ‚Äî Sprint 2

## Overview
Our team is developing a **Sports Betting Web Application** that integrates backend services (API, AI recommendation engine) and frontend (Next.js). The focus of this sprint was on **DevOps, CI/CD integration, and testing** to ensure a stable and reproducible environment.

## ‚úÖ Completed This Sprint
- **Docker & DevOps Setup**
  - Created `docker-compose.yml` to run API, AI, web, and DB services.
  - Added `docker/Makefile` for easy start/stop/logs commands.
  - Added troubleshooting section to `OPERATIONS.md`.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**
  - Configured GitHub Actions for automated pytest runs.
  - Fixed YAML errors and improved job structure.
  - Verified CI/CD builds for both `api` and `ai` services.

- **Testing**
  - Added `docs/TEST_PLAN.md` (testing goals, frameworks, schedule).
  - Implemented `services/api/tests/test_routes.py` with unit tests.
  - Documented results in `docs/TEST_RESULTS.md`.

- **Bug Fixes**
  - Fixed missing Dockerfiles for `api` and `web`.
  - Resolved legacy Docker Compose flag (`-f` vs `--file`).
  - Addressed container recreation error via `docker-compose rm`.

- **Peer Reviews**
  - Reviewed teammates‚Äô PRs and provided suggestions for improvements.
  - Helped ensure consistent documentation and CI setup.

## üöÄ Next Sprint Goals
- Add real database models for users and games.
- Connect AI service to API for prediction endpoints.
- Expand test coverage to include integration and UI tests.
- Enhance frontend (Next.js) to display live data from backend.

## üß© Notes
This sprint focused on infrastructure stability and collaboration. All core backend components (API, AI, Web) now build and run successfully in Docker, and CI pipelines verify functionality automatically.
